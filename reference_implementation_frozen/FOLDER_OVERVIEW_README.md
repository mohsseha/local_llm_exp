# Folder Overview: CFO's Files for Generate Biomedicines

This repository contains a collection of files and emails from the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Generate Biomedicines. Generate Biomedicines is a pioneering biotechnology company that leverages generative artificial intelligence to revolutionize drug discovery and development. Their innovative approach allows them to program novel protein-based therapies, aiming to create medicines more efficiently and effectively than traditional methods.

The files in this collection have been converted from their original formats (such as `.eml`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.xlsx`) into Markdown (`.md`) format. This conversion was performed to standardize the content and make it more accessible for analysis and review.

## File Structure Transformation

The original file structure, which looked like this:

```
data
├── FY2023
│   └── Q4
│       └── Investor_Relations
│           ├── attachment_with_exotic_filename.eml
│           ├── corrupted_body.eml
│           ├── html_only.eml
│           ├── report.docx
│           └── winmail_attachment.eml
├── .donotdelete
└── readme.md
```

Has been transformed into the following structure:

```
data.md
├── FY2023
│   └── Q4
│       └── Investor_Relations
│           ├── attachment_no_filename.thread.md
│           ├── cazbttkypj.txt
│           ├── extremely_long_subject.thread.md
│           └── no_message_id.thread.md
├── .git
└── readme.md.md
```

As you can see, email files (`.eml`) have been converted into threaded markdown documents (`.thread.md`), and other documents have been converted to `.md` files. This process allows for easier version control, diffing, and collaboration on the content within this repository.
